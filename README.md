Briefly explain the work that you did on this project:  What code were you given?  What code did you create yourself?  
This project tasked us with developing a Q learning algorithm for a two dimensional maze.  The project involves a "pirate" intelligent agent which 
makes use of a neural network to reach its goal.  The code provided to us was the environment / scene, as well as the conditions and rules.  
It also provided some pseudocode / examples of how to make use of the existing game state.  The code I wrote was the Q-training algorithm, 
which helps the intelligent agent to explore or exploit its possible actions for maximum reward.  The goal is to find the optimal epoch count.   

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:  
Machine learning, artificial intelligence, neural networks, etc, are all increasingly important things for a computer scientist to understand.  
As time progresses, AI is more and more involved in our lives, and its role is exponentially growing in a ton of different fields.  
By learning and practicing with these tools, we set ourselves up for success in the future in the field of computer science.  

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?  
A computer scientist by definition is just a scientist that studies and works in the field of computers.  I think that the importance of digital technology
is evident- we use computers to great effect all the time- so the importance of understanding and innovating in the field is clear to me.  
Developments in the speed and efficiency of computer science translates to speed and efficiency in medical fields, research and collaboration in business, better
communication with friends and family, etc.  

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?  
Breaking problems down into simple, solvable steps is the solution to pretty much every problem we come across.  We develop steps for a computer to follow- 
so it stands to reason that breaking down the tasks into smaller issues and solving them one at a time is an essential skill to learn.  Building these steps into a
followable algorithm is the essential process that every program does.  

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?  
Generally, the work we provide as computer scientists to an end user / organization is obligated because it's agreed upon, and it is important that it works as 
expected so as to not release software that could jeopardize progress and safety.  We also have ethical responsibilities with data and privacy, to keep it safe and 
hidden, out of other people's hands.
